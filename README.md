# Introduction

This repository is a code challenge. My challenge was to create a web application for ordering pizza where the user gets to make his own pizza by choosing every detail within a couple steps. Also, if the user doesn't want to choose a pizza on his own, I provided a made pizza with its content already chosen.

# Project

### JSON Server

JSON Server is a perfect fake api creator for representing the backend of the application, however, this is only recommended in small applications where you don't have a lot of data to check on, which made it perfect for the purpose of my app.

### React

One of the most popular library aka "Framework" in the Javascript scene, solid and performatic! The best tool to get the job done in a much easier and less complicated way.!

### React-Icons

Great library that provides the most popular icons to be used very quickly. Literally import and use.

### Styled Components

Styled Components is one of the best pair-ups with React, it makes creating elements and editing them a lot easier and faster, makes the app look a lot cleaner and much easier to find a mistake and fix it.

### React Redux

A great Javascript Library that works perfectly with React when it comes to manage the global state of the app, especially now in its newest version where you can combine it with React Hooks. I sure abused it in this app haha

### Axios

Really good tool and very easy to use, makes getting information from the backend look so nice and smooth.

# Setup

1. Clone this repository.
1. Open your terminal and when inside the cloned folder run `yarn or npm install` to install all the missing dependencies.
1. Then run `json-server --watch -p 5555 db.json` to start the backend structure.
1. Then just run `yarn start or npm start` and enjoy your pizza, at least making it...
